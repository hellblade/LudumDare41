# Ludum Dare 41 - "Run and Plant!"

This is my game made for the ludum dare. Made with Unity 2017.4.

Took to long to think of a theme so game is a bit rushed and basic. The idea for it is a cross between an endless runner and a farming game. Find or buy things to plant and in a later run they will have grown and be ready to provide you with benefits.
